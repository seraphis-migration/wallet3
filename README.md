# wallet3

This repository contains info and discussions about a so-far hypothetical full wallet rewrite from scratch to implement Seraphis and Jamtis support in the Monero codebase, a project with a "working title" of *wallet3*.

The code would use @UkoeHB's Seraphis function library that is [here](https://github.com/UkoeHB/monero/tree/seraphis_lib/src/seraphis). (See also the [resources](https://github.com/seraphis-migration/strategy/wiki/Seraphis-and-Jamtis-Resources) page in the strategy wiki.)
